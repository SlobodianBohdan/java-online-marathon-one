// Create class Animal with fields age (int) and weight (double) that can be accessed in the same package only. Animal should have method move without implementation, accessible from everywhere in the application.
// Animal should have a public constructor with parameters age and weight for initialization corresponding fields.

// Create Descendant classes Mammal, Fish, and Bird. 
// For Mammal method move returns "run", for Fish - "swim", for Bird - "fly".
// Make it impossible to create descendants of Fish and Bird.
// Forbid overriding method move for Mammal.
