// Create the method writeFile(String filename, String text) that write the text to file as sequence of bytes in binary format.
// For example, the text fragment
// should be represented in the file as a sequence of 7-bit bytes without spaces between them:
// If less than 7 bits are required to represent the character then add to binary sequence leading zeros '0'.
// * For correct passing of all tests don't use print and println methods in your code.
